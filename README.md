[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/idaks/cap_problem/HEAD)
## Introduction
In this repo, we are trying to show three demos
One group contains k_color_demo and k_cap_problem, where we will discuss how can we ensure whether one graph/instance is k-colorable/k-allocable or the minium to 
- classic coloring problem (col) 
- container allocation problem (cap)

Besides this, we provide a demo to illustrate how can we use ASP to verify k-col can be reduced to k-cap

## Binder
we provide binder for easy use without installing any packages locally

## Conda Env
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cap
jupyter notebook
```
